# Basic-Banking-System
This is a project I have created for my internship program at The Sparks Foundation.
Its a web application used to transfer money between multiple users.
Currently, there are already 10 users existing in the database.

Language used - 
              Front-end : HTML, CSS
              Back-end :  PHP 
              Database :  MySQL

Database contains two Tables- Customers Table & Transfers Table

Customers table has fields such as id, name, email & balance.
Transfers table records all transfers happened along with their time.

The website comtains four web pages:
1. Home Page
2. All Customers Page
3. Transaction Page
4. History Page
